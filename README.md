Day 6 - Modules and Instance Variables

## Challenge

1. Find the sum of these numbers.
2. Find the average of all the numbers.

## Today

1. Challenge (sums and average)
2. Lab Review
3. Instance Variables
4. Modules

## Homework

Widgets, Robots, and Pandas

1. Create a class definition for a Widget, a Robot, and a Panda
2. Do not use inheritance, but use Modules for code-reuse
3. All should have a "name" and a "greeting" method. The name should return the
   value held in an instance variable "@name"
4. Widgets and Robots should have a "Start" and "End" method. They should output
   "Started..." and "Ended..." respectively
5. Pandas should have a "Eat" method with an argument "food". It should then
   return "Yum, I ate #{food}"
6. A Robot should have a method "terminator?" which returns if that robot is a
   terminator (instance variable)
7. All should have a "asleep?" which returns if a panda is asleep and if a
   widget is off.
8. Pandas have a "sleep" and "wake" method.
